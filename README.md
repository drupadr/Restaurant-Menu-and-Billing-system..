# Restaurant-Menu-and-Billing-system
This was the very first project that was done by me in 1st year. It has been coded in C. This project was created keeping in my mind the efficiency and cost issues that restaurants all over the world face. We wanted to create a direct link between the customers and people working in the kitchen eliminating the need for waiters and managers. This project enables the customer to directly place their order without having to wait for the waiters to come and take their order. Once the order is placed the food is prepared and is then served to the customers by a robot which was designed using the Firebird-V bot provided to us IIT Bombay's Eyantra robotics club and at the end of their meal the customers directly get the bill displayed to them and the required payment can be made either through offline or online payment methods.
This entire setup greatly benefits the restaurant by reducung the cost of waiters and managers and also improves the efficiency as there will be no mistakes made.
